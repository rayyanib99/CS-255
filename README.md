# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Based on the information acquired during the interview, we concluded that the customer, DriverPass, intended to develop a training program for new drivers or failed pupils awaiting their driver's license. The training program system was to be a web application that allows students or system users to effectively study, prepare, and test in order to successfully earn a driver's license in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Moreover, DriverPass would like to provide an appointment-setting service, which would be available both by phone and online. The issue DriverPass seeks to address is that too many student drivers fail their test on their first attempt. They want to improve the success rate of student drivers who fail on their first attempt. DriverPass has identified a void or lack of training and systems as such and so would like to fill it. So, they intend to develop a learning user interface that includes progress monitoring, driver notes, personal information, reservation, package/subscription, special needs, and learning modules/courses. Furthermore, DriverPass wishes to maintain a connection with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) system in order to comply with their regulations. Finally, they want employee access and modification functionality in the system so that they may change their employee information and access.

# What did you do particularly well?

I believe something I excelled at or did well was the designing of the UML diagrams especially the UML activity and class diagrams. I came to this conclusion based on the feedback I received from the instructor as well as my classmates through the discussion posts. Also, I think conveying technical ideas to a non-technical audience using non-technical vernacular was another thing I think I did well in as I do that pretty regularly at my current job.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would have to say revising the UML class diagram as I think there could be infinite possibilities as to what could have been included especially in the behaviors or methods, staying in line with the client's requirements.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by often putting myself in a user's shoes and compared this system to other similar systems to understand what a user may go through and need to successfully use the DriverPass application. Considering the user's needs in the design process leads to more effective, usable, and valuable solutions. It enhances user satisfaction, improves usability and accessibility, increases efficiency and productivity, reduces costs and iterations, and provides a competitive advantage in the market.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I usually use a sequential approach. Firstly, I jot down the main objectives or requirements. Secondly, I start to translate my written notes into visuals using diagrams or the like. Lastly, I begin the coding part. Perhaps, in the future, I would like to become more well-versed in methods or approaches that may be more efficient and valuable than my current approach.
